Lawrence: So, all you gotta do is avoid him... on the last few hours on Friday, duck out early, turn off your answering machine... you should be home free, man. ...

Dom Portwood: Hi, Peter. What's happening? We need to talk about your TPS reports. ... Peter Gibbons: Yeah. The coversheet. I know, I know. Uh, Bill talked to me about it. ... Dom Portwood: Yeah. Did you get that memo? ... Peter Gibbons: Yeah. I got the memo. And I understand the policy. And the problem is just that I forgot the one time. And I've already taken care of it so it's not even really a problem anymore. ... Dom Portwood: Ah! Yeah. It's just we're putting new coversheets on all the TPS reports before they go out now. So if you could go ahead and try to remember to do that from now on, that'd be great. All right! ...  ...

Peter Gibbons: [about the plan to steal from Initech] Before we go any further, all right, we have to swear to God, Allah, that nobody knows about this but us, all right?

[Peter, Michael, and Samir are chatting as they hang around the printer] ... Peter Gibbons: Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you'd do if you had a million dollars and you didn't have to work. And invariably what you'd say was supposed to be your career. So, if you wanted to fix old cars then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic. ... Samir: So what did you say? ... Peter Gibbons: I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech. ... Michael Bolton: No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to begin with. If everyone listened to her, there'd be no janitors, because no one would clean shit up if they had a million dollars. ... Samir: You know what I would do if I had a million dollars? I would invest half of it in low risk mutual funds and then take the other half over to my friend Asadulah who works in securities... ... Michael Bolton: Samir, you're missing the point. The point of the exercise is that you're supposed to figure out what you would want to do if... ... [printer starts beeping] ... Michael Bolton: "PC Load Letter"?

Peter Gibbons: The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care. ... Bob Porter: Don't... don't care? ... Peter Gibbons: It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime, so where's the motivation? And here's something else, Bob: I have eight different bosses right now. ... Bob Slydell: I beg your pardon? ... Peter Gibbons: Eight bosses. ... Bob Slydell: Eight? ... Peter Gibbons: Eight, Bob. So that means that when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my only real motivation is not to be hassled, that and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired. ...  ...

And I think if I were a millionaire I could hook that up, too; 'cause chicks dig dudes with money. ... Peter Gibbons: Well, not all chicks. ... Lawrence: Well, the type of chicks that'd double up on a dude like me do. ... Peter Gibbons: Good point. ... Lawrence: Well, what about you now? what would you do? ... Peter Gibbons: Besides two chicks at the same time? ... Lawrence: Well, yeah. ... Peter Gibbons: Nothing. ... Lawrence: Nothing, huh? ... Peter Gibbons: I would relax...

Peter Gibbons: Well see, they wrote all this bank software, and, uh, to save space, they used two digits for the date instead of four. So, like, 98 instead of 1998? Uh, so I go through these thousands of lines of code and, uh... it doesn't really matter. I uh, I don't like my job, and, uh, I don't think I'm gonna go anymore. ...

Milton Waddams: [talking on the phone] And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire... ...  ...
